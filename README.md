# Senior-Design

**Description:** Designed a solar-powered cooler with a team of electrical engineering students. I was given ownership of the embedded systems block. Designed a user interface through the Waveshare touch screen with a simple menu and options to adjust the temperature, turn the cooling system on or off, and adjust the screen brightness. Arduino received user input and temperature data and sent signals to appropriate hardware blocks.
